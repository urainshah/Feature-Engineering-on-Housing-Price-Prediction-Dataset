# Feature-Engineering-on-Housing-Price-Prediction-Dataset
In this Notebook, I have used the dataset “Housing Price Prediction”. Our focus was on EDA for the given features. As there where both categorical as well as numerical features we had separate them and treat them differently. Different kinds of plots are used to view the different dimensionality of Features. Now it is good to be used for training and testing the models.
